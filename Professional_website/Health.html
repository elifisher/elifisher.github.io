    <h4>Health Insurance</h4>
    <img class="fixedimg" src="hospital.avif" alt="Hospital">
    <p> "Health insurance pays most medical and surgical expenses and preventative care costs incurred by the insured
        person in return for a monthly premium payment.
        Generally, the higher the monthly premium is the lower the out-of-pocket costs are to the insured.
        Virtually all insurance plans have deductibles and co-pays but these out-of-pocket expenses are now capped by
        federal law. Since 2010, the Affordable Care Act has prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to
        patients with
        preexisting conditions and has allowed children to remain on their parents' insurance plan until they reach the
        age of 26.
        U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Fact Sheet: Celebrating the Affordable Care Act.”
        Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are federal health insurance plans that
        extend coverage to older, disabled, and low-income people."</p>
