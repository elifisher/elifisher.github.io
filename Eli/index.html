	<p>Above is a pitcure of me and my wife. We have
		been married for almost three years now and it has
		been quite a wild ride. We got married in Arkansas,
		the state I was born in. Shortly after our marriage
		we decided it was in our best interest to move to
		missouri. We have been in missouri for around two years.</p>
