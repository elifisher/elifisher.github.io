	<h1>One Of My Hobbys</h1>
	<h2>Taking picturse of my dogs</h2>
	<div>
		<h3><img src="IMG_6339.heic.jpeg" alt="Dog 1" width="250"></h3>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4><img src="IMG_6355.jpg" alt="Dog 2" width="250"></h4>
	</div>

	<p>Shown above are pictures of my dogs. Taking pictures
		of my dogs is one of my hobbys although a seemingly
		underwelming one. My wife likes to decorate for Christmas
		early every year. Therefore I take advantage of the decorations
		and take several pictures of my dogs. My wife enjoys putting them
		in varrying costumes depending on what outfits are available
		for her to purchase.</p>
