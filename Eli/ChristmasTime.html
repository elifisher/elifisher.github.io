    <p class="Christmasfun">My wife and I always decorate for Christmas at least five months
        in advance every year. This is because when I proposed to her it
        was during Christmas time. The first date we had was also around
        Christmas time. Thats just one of the reasons Christmas is so
        important to my family. Thats why I felt it necessary to add
        to a website about me.
